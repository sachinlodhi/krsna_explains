In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questioned K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as to his best course of action.

Devotional service is easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And in the Fourth Chapter the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has perplexed Arjuna and confused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that sanny\u0101sa, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity, because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: This body, O son of Kunt\u012b, is called the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.", "purport": "Arjuna was inquisitive about prak\u1e5bti (nature), puru\u1e63a (the enjoyer), k\u1e63etra (the field), k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a (its knower), and knowledge and the object of knowledge. When he inquired about all these, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that this body is called the field and that one who knows this body is called the knower of the field. This body is the field of activity for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul is entrapped in material existence, and he attempts to lord it over material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a field of activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is the body? The body is made of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and, according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or field of activity. Therefore the body is called k\u1e63etra, or the field of activity for the conditioned soul. Now, the person, who should not identify himself with the body, is called k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to understand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the knower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the actual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that he is different from the body. It is described in the beginning \u2013 dehino \u2019smin \u2013 that the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing. The owner is distinctly k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a. Sometimes we think, \u201cI am happy,\u201d \u201cI am a man,\u201d \u201cI am a woman,\u201d \u201cI am a dog,\u201d \u201cI am a cat.\u201d These are the bodily designations of the knower. But the knower is different from the body. Although we may use many articles \u2013 our clothes, etc. \u2013 we know that we are different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand by a little contemplation that we are different from the body.
